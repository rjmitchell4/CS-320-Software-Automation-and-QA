# CS-320

This project was completed for CS 320 Software Test Automation and QA
While coding in itself is a skill that is always developing, it is important to always remember that there are threats and malicious entities that exist in the world and on the
internet. Testing your code and ensuring that vulnerabilities are covered will be the most important factor in ensuring the long term success of a project or application. Once functionality is tested and successful, the next step is to be able to manually review your code. Manually reviewing your code is important to making sure you understand what's
going on and aren't just depending on a program to check things for you. Inevitably, code becomes too vast and too much for any one person to secure by yourself. The use of
automated testing is essential in accounting for human error. In this project, I relied on the JUnit testing packages provided by Eclipse, but using any sort of testing package
is necessary.
It is also important to always focus on the end goal of a commissioned project. The final product must serve the purpose requested, and then after can adjustments be made
according to preferences. When approaching software design, I've always believed that testing as you go and being as simple as possible in the beginning is the key to creating a
strong foundation for a good application. Quality was the first lesson taught in my computer science classes, and now I have reached the levels where assuring that quality can
match its security is the biggest priority.
